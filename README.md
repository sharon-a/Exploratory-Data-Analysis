# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
## This is the first project on Coursera's course Exploratory Data Analysis

## In order to run the script please:
## Download the dataset from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip.
## In my case I downloaded it to C:\Users\agtuyy\Documents\GitHub\Exploratory-Data-Analysis
## and then set up that folder as my working directory on R Studio.
